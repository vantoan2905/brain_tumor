## Introduction
Brain tumor segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, helping in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of brain tumors. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to accurately segment brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset**, which contains MRI scans with annotated brain tumors. The dataset includes multiple modalities:
- T1
- T1c (T1 with contrast enhancement)
- T2
- FLAIR

### Downloading the Dataset
You can download the dataset from the [BraTS Challenge website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html).

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and several dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-segmentation.git
    cd brain-tumor-segmentation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the data**: Convert the raw MRI scans into a format suitable for training.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py --data_dir path/to/dataset --output_dir path/to/preprocessed_data
    ```

2. **Train the model**:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_dir path/to/preprocessed_data --model_dir path/to/save_model
    ```

3. **Evaluate the model**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_dir path/to/saved_model --data_dir path/to/test_data
    ```

4. **Predict using the model**:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --model_dir path/to/saved_model --input_image path/to/input_image --output_image path/to/output_image
    ```

## Model Architecture
The model used in this project is a variant of the U-Net architecture, specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to retain high-resolution features.

## Training
To train the model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure your data is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Modify the `config.yaml` file to set your training parameters.
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```

## Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using standard metrics such as Dice coefficient, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation script will generate these metrics and save the results.

## Results
After training and evaluating the model, the results can be visualized using various plots and metrics reports. The `results/` directory contains sample outputs and evaluation metrics.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance this project! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
